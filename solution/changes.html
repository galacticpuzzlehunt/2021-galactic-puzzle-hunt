<p>The puzzle consists of a sequence of transformations that are applied to the input words. Solvers can input words into the text boxes at the top and, at each stage, check the checkboxes to indicate which words should be transformed. Each stage requires a fixed number of checkboxes to be checked, except for a single stage where all checkboxes must be checked.</p>
<p>After the stage&rsquo;s transformation is applied, words that are not in the puzzle&rsquo;s dictionary are crossed out and removed as inputs to the following stage. (Hard mode switches the puzzle to use a smaller word list whose words are more common; words that are crossed out but would be allowed in easy mode are colored differently.) Some transformations can leave a word unchanged, but words otherwise cannot repeat within a row or from previous stages; repeated words are also crossed out and removed in the next stage.</p>
<p>The transformations as described below are often nondeterministic. Usually, the transformation is applied in a way so as to maximize the number of legal words remaining and then to use the alphabetically earliest result, with a few exceptions. As additional hints and confirmation to how stages work, each stage displays a fraction; the denominator indicates how many possibilities there are for resolving the transformation, while the numerator indicates the number of possibilities that produces all legal words.</p>
<p>Through trial and error, solvers can determine how each transformation works. In addition, if solvers find a set of words and transformation targets that passes through all stages, brackets appear around certain letters in the process, chosen by an extraction method that solvers can determine and that will be useful later; furthermore, a message appears at the bottom. Note that multiple pairs of brackets can appear in a single stage, but all will extract the same letter and should be treated as extracting one letter for the final result.</p>
<p>A few example save states from testsolvers that get through all stages:</p>

<p>The message is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well done! Now find the eight secret words to apply Changes to. It may be helpful to consult a Book.</p>
<p>(P.S. Remember that this is an American hunt.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The capitalized words hint at the Book of Changes, another name for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Ching">I Ching</a>, which features the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagua">bagua</a>, or Eight Trigrams. There is not a universally canonical translation of these trigrams, but we went with HEAVEN, LAKE, FIRE, THUNDER, WIND, WATER, MOUNTAIN, EARTH.</p>
<p>If solvers enter any of these words, all transformations&rsquo; inputs and outputs are replaced with ?&rsquo;s, which also allows solvers to confirm the exact set of eight words the puzzle is looking for. If solvers enter all eight words, all inputs and outputs are bolded and highlighted. Because the transformation results are obscured, solvers must use their understanding of the transformations to determine what the actual inputs and outputs to each stage are and transform the right words in the right order.</p>
<p>This often requires some amount of lookahead and is not obviously unique, though it was chosen to generally have more compelling words than alternatives and to have the exact same behavior whether or not hard mode is enabled. Some high-level guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Although the results of any experimentation are obscured, solvers can still see their lengths and whether they&rsquo;re valid words, which can help them check their hypotheses as they go.</li>
<li>The stage that requires all words to be the same length is quite strict, though there remain a few ambiguities, most prominently which two of FINCH/WINCH/LEACH should be chosen. Afterwards, it&rsquo;s unclear which word should be beheaded to give INCH to allow WORMS. This is resolved by FLINCH.</li>
<li>Similarly, CONCH is an option in the bigram replacing phase, but being able to produce an embedding like COVENANT is a strong constraint.</li>

<p>A save state: <code>1,EARTH,FIRE,HEAVEN,LAKE,MOUNTAIN,THUNDER,WATER,WIND,IFEIBBAQQf8GAoKAQSghCSgSCFARMhpcaEzAwA==</code></p>
<p>Solvers can also circumvent much of the obscuring mechanic by finding a set of words that, after a few transformations, produce the same set of words that they expect the Trigrams to produce after the same transformations (possibly applied to different words). Here&rsquo;s a save state (using partial work from Pusheen Fan Club) that converges after only four transformations: <code>0,HAVEN,LIANE,FINE,UNDER,WILD,WATERING,MOUNT,UNEARTH,QGgEAUBAKP8UCAoIIISABIRAEGBAwCBgwIDAwA==</code>.</p>
<p>When the correct transformations are applied, the extraction brackets reappear. After determining the inputs and outputs, solvers can determine which letters are extracted. Those letters spell out ANTERIOR EYE FLUID, a cluephrase for the answer, <strong>AQUEOUS HUMOR</strong> (and not HUMOUR, as gently hinted by the endnote).</p>

    
    
    <h2 id="authors-notes">Author&rsquo;s Notes</h2>
    <p>In keeping with my continued habit of <a href="https://2020.galacticpuzzlehunt.com/puzzle/intersections">incorporating every possible hobby into a puzzlehunt puzzle</a>, this puzzle is <em>very vaguely</em> inspired by my recent experience with FFXIV savage raids, and thinking about what they&rsquo;d look like (in particular, their mechanics) if turned into puzzlehunt puzzles. Things like, if exactly one of your party members will be forced to lose some HP (letters), you want it to be a tank who has more HP (letters). I even wrote a little bit of a draft that was going to be titled &ldquo;Full Party&rdquo;, in which the eight secret words were BARD, DRAGOON, MONK, PALADIN, SAGE, SCHOLAR, SUMMONER, WARRIOR (which is not the only standard composition consisting of only Scrabble-legal words, and admittedly includes two shield healers, but it&rsquo;s actually pretty constrained; and though unusual, shield healer pairs are actually doing <a href="https://www.fflogs.com/zone/statistics/44/#metric=healercombineddps">pretty</a> <a href="https://www.fflogs.com/zone/statistics/49#metric=healercombinedbossdps">impressive</a> average damage); but my editors quickly convinced me this was a bad idea. Still, I ended up sticking with the size of a full party in FFXIV for no real reason other than inertia. (With a little more raid experience ‚Äî as of two days before the release of this note, I just cleared the first savage raid of the most recent tier, hilariously released the Tuesday of hunt ‚Äî I am sure that there are better ways to capture the puzzly nature in a puzzlehunt puzzle, which I will probably continue thinking about in the future.)</p>
<p>Oddly enough (but quite thematically for a time loop hunt), one of my editors pointed out that the puzzle idea resembles a combination of one of my first published puzzlehunt puzzles, 2015 MH&rsquo;s <a href="https://puzzles.mit.edu/2015/puzzle/pipe/">Pipe</a>, with the meta it fed into, the <a href="https://puzzles.mit.edu/2015/puzzle/coral_reef_meta/">Coral Reef Meta</a>.</p>
<p>The first testsolvable draft did not provide you with the lengths of the input/outputs or extraction brackets if you submitted any of the eight trigrams, with the intent that you&rsquo;d have to be very confident in the transformations and also experimentally determine the exact rules for extracting letters. However, this would require solvers to find multiple very different solutions in order to extract unambiguously (you can&rsquo;t be certain if you&rsquo;re extracting the <i>n</i>th letter, the <i>n</i>th-from-last letter, or some letter related to the transformed letter), which turned out not to be that fun, not to mention how it would make an already long puzzle even longer.</p>
<p>Fun fact: UKACD (in this context, best known for being Qat&rsquo;s default dictionary) has &ldquo;inchworm&rdquo; but not &ldquo;inchworms&rdquo;, which caused one of our testsolves to get stuck for more than an hour. This fact, and the American spelling of HUMOR required for the meta, sort-of prompted the endnote; Qat does work if you tell it to use the &ldquo;American&rdquo; list YAWL. (Completionist puzzlers with a long memory may also recognize the endnote as a reference to a certain MUMS Puzzle Hunt confirmation message&hellip;)</p>
