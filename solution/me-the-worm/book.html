<h3 id="1">Page 1</h3>
<p>“Ah, what a good day to be a humble earthworm!” you say to yourself.<br><br>You just love being a simple earthworm. Squirming in the dirt, eating micronutrients. Sometimes your relatives come to visit. Isn’t this just the peak of life?<br><br>If you would like to think a big thought, <a href='#2'>turn to the next page</a>.</p>

<h3 id="2">Page 2</h3>
<p>A thought enters your small but sufficient brain. You live in the dirt. You have a vague idea of what you’ll find if you go up, but what about if you were to dig <i>down</i>?<br><br>If you would like to forget this thought and live normally, <a href='#3'>turn to the next page</a>.<br>If you would like to dig down, <a href='#41'>turn to page 41</a>.</p>

<p>You wander down a back alley. On the side of the alley is a dumpster stuffed full of rotting garbage. It smells delicious! All this going up and down has made you pretty hungry, so you hop in.<br><br>“Hey, how are you!” “Did you hear about that flock of birds? I heard that hundreds of worms were eaten!” The dumpster is filled with the chatter of other worms. In worm culture, the dumpster is the place to see and be seen. You self-consciously smooth the membrane of your head; it's gotten all roughed up from all the digging you were doing.<br><br>You start in on a discarded chicken nugget. It’s highly nutritious.<br><br>There is a mysterious black bag in front of you. The end is open at the top. It looks full.<br><br>If you would like to go into the mysterious black bag, <a href='#9'>turn to page 9</a>.<br>If you would like to leave the dumpster, <a href='#98'>turn to page 98</a>.</p>

<p>“… how you have enough money for getting high in the sky?”<br><br>“Well, I normally kind of keep my money hidden, but since you asked, I'll show you.”<br><br>Fly pulls out a coin with a strange symbol on it.<br><br><img class="symbol" src="/static/puzzle_resources/me-the-worm/symbol.png"><br><br>“I found this weird coin the other day out on the pavement. I don't think it's worth a lot, but I decided to keep it anyway.”<br><br>If you would like to ask Fly what the symbol means, <a href='#6'>turn to the next page</a>.<br>If you would like to ask Fly something else, <a href='#112'>turn to page 112</a>.</p>

<h3 id="6">Page 6</h3>
<p>“Do you know what that symbol means?” you ask.<br><br>"The symbol on the coin? It means that the coin is important in this section of the book! The length of this section is 6, by the way (don't include the ending page).”<br><br>If you would like to ask Fly something else, <a href='#112'>turn to page 112</a>.</p>

<h3 id="7">Page 7</h3>
<p>You bite into the apple with enthusiasm. Hey, it’s pretty good. You visit the solid core of the apple, having checked out the juicier bits, and you try eating one of the seeds. Suddenly, your vision blurs and you feel dizzy. The last thing you think of before you die is… <i>oh, cyanide</i>.<br><br>THE END</p>

<h3 id="8">Page 8</h3>
<p>You take a look around. In one direction, there is a forest. Farther away, a mountain pokes up into the sky.<br><br>If you would like to go to the mountain, <a href='#94'>turn to page 94</a>.<br>If you would like to go to the forest, <a href='#90'>turn to page 90</a>.<br>If you would like to bask, <a href='#83'>turn to page 83</a>.<br>If you would like to go back home, <a href='#3'>turn to page 3</a>.</p>

<h3 id="9">Page 9</h3>
<p>The black bag is filled with some small shards of plastic and metal. Not exactly a good meal for a worm. You absentmindedly toss a pile of metal filings onto the ground. The filings arrange themselves into a pattern.<br><br><img class="symbol" src="/static/puzzle_resources/me-the-worm/symbol.png"><br><br>If you were paying attention, you would have found their spontaneous arrangement interesting. But you are distracted by a big, juicy fuji apple rotting right in front of you! Can you believe your luck!<br><br>You would like to eat the apple. <a href='#7'>Turn to page 7</a>.</p>

<h3 id="10">Page 10</h3>
<p>You approach the orange bird. “Hey, just passing through!” you say weakly.<br><br>The bird catches sight of your movement, and its head swivels around so that both of its eyes are focused on you.<br><br>“It’s a worm.”<br><br>A moment passes. The bird closes its eyes. Another moment passes. You continue to move forward.<br><br>Meanwhile, the sea of grass-covered worms has advanced farther.<br><br>It’s not long before you come across another branch with two more bird guards, a green bird and a yellow bird.<br><br>If you would like to talk to the green bird, <a href='#66'>turn to page 66</a>.<br>If you would like to talk to the yellow bird, <a href='#16'>turn to page 16</a>.</p>

<h3 id="20">Page 20</h3>
<p>You pull up to the street corner and start chilling so hard it should be a crime.<br><br>“Me. The worm. Ah yesss,” you say to yourself.<br><br>Suddenly, you feel yourself lifted off the ground. A human has pinched you between two of its fingers!<br><br>“Help! Help! Help!” Your voice is clearly not heard by anyone bigger than a breadbox.<br><br>If you would like to bite the finger, <a href='#71'>turn to page 71</a>.<br>If you would like to squirm furiously, <a href='#22'>turn to page 22</a>.</p>

<h3 id="21">Page 21</h3>
<p>You dig deeper. You dig faster. Your body writhes in furious contraction and expansion.<br><br>This is the farthest you’ve ever been from home. <i>I am not afraid</i>.<br><br>The pressure starts to build. <i>Please, it’s nothing I can’t handle</i>.<br><br>It’s getting hot. Very hot. <i>I can do anything</i>.<br><br>You find yourself digging through a seething, burning, molten mass of liquid metal. Is your body still moving? You’ve been compressed into a gooey pulp. <i>Nice</i>.<br><br>THE END</p>

<h3 id="22">Page 22</h3>
<p>You wriggle your little body as vigorously as it’s able, but to no avail.<br><br>“What a fascinating specimen!”<br><br>The person is a worm collector (nematologist? nematophile? you can't really tell the difference from here… maybe there are more important things to be thinking about right now). They put you in a clear box and put you on the shelf above the fireplace. You wonder what you’re doing here.<br><br>You live out the rest of your days hanging out in a box above the fireplace. Hey, at least you’re a warm worm here.<br><br>THE END</p>

<p>Butterfly opens the door to their immaculately decorated flat, and you inch in. “Earthworm! It’s been far too long,” they greet you excitedly. You don’t have a sense of smell, but you nonetheless get the sense that food is cooking nearby. You’re hungry, but your old friend Potato Bug told you that he didn’t trust Butterfly before he disappeared.

<p>“Hey Bookworm, can you remind me about your Save the Worms movement again? It’s something about how worms are always drowning, right?”<br><br>Bookworm says, “Save the Worms is about the plight that we worms face when it rains. For a worm whose home has poor drainage due to disrepair, rain can force it to abandon its home and squirm out onto the pavement, which usually has some dry patches during a rainstorm.”<br><br>“But once out on the pavement, a worm is no longer safe. Besides the constant danger of birds, the primary threat is humans who step right on the poor worm. Human negligence is without parallel! Not to mention, I’ve seen so many worms with midsections flattened by bicycle tires.”<br><br>“The movement is trying to do two things. First, we fix up worm houses which are in danger of flooding during rain. Second, we attempt to raise awareness in the human world so that not so many worms are stepped on during rainstorms.”<br><br>If you would like to contribute money towards the “Save the Worms” movement, you can <a target='_blank' href='https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=L4CVDVR3VTLZJ'>donate to us here</a>.<br>If you would like to ask Bookworm something else, <a href='#49'>turn to page 49</a>.</p>

<p>You put on your darkest pair of worm-fitted sunglasses and stretch out fully. Here in the light of the sun, it’s so warm and toasty.<br><br>    Actually, it’s a little too warm, and you don’t notice that you’re drying out until it’s too late. You shrivel up.

You freeze, pretending to be a stick or a discarded piece of chewing gum.<br><br>You lay in the grass, praying to the Holy Worm that nobirdy sees you. Over the next few minutes, ten colorful birds arrive nearby. You think that it might be useful to remember their order in case they try to kill you later.

You see the very small creature darting through the air, hovering in different places long enough to be drawing some sort of symbol in the air. You watch, transfixed, and memorize the symbol.

<p>You climb ever higher up the mountain. The path winds around boulders, trees, and stumps. It’s not easy going.<br><br>You come upon an icy river running swiftly.

<p>You enter at the edge of the icy river. Your mom never taught you how to swim.

<p>You step out onto the decaying bridge. The first plank groans, but holds your weight.<br><br>Until it doesn’t. The plank splinters apart, and your body falls through the rupture. Your shoe catches on the shard of the plank. You are dangling upside down from the bridge, with your rear end barely gripping the wood of the bridge. The icy water rushes in front of your face, roaring. Deathly peril fills you.<br><br>You flex your massive abs and reach your front end up, desperately clawing for a grip. You latch onto the next plank. With both ends contacting the bridge, you haul yourself up to the height of the bridge.<br><br>Your five hearts are throbbing. You take a gasp. You move to the next plank, then the next. Each plank groans, but holds you.<br><br>You step onto the far bank of the bridge, and the feeling of imminent danger evaporates. You lay down in the dirt, feeling mentally drained. You’re glad you didn’t fall into the icy river. You don’t know how to swim, and that water was moving very fast. You probably would have drowned.<br><br>Some time later, you decide to continue with your climb.<br><br>The trail winds vaguely up and up. Off to the side of the trail, you catch sight of an abyss.
