<p>‚ÄúAh, what a good day to be a humble earthworm!‚Äù you say to yourself.<br><br>You just love being a simple earthworm. Squirming in the dirt, eating micronutrients. Sometimes your relatives come to visit. Isn‚Äôt this just the peak of life?<br><br>If you would like to think a big thought, <a href='#2'>turn to the next page</a>.</p>

<h3 id="2">Page 2</h3>
<p>A thought enters your small but sufficient brain. You live in the dirt. You have a vague idea of what you‚Äôll find if you go up, but what about if you were to dig <i>down</i>?<br><br>If you would like to forget this thought and live normally, <a href='#3'>turn to the next page</a>.<br>If you would like to dig down, <a href='#41'>turn to page 41</a>.</p>

<p>You wander down a back alley. On the side of the alley is a dumpster stuffed full of rotting garbage. It smells delicious! All this going up and down has made you pretty hungry, so you hop in.<br><br>‚ÄúHey, how are you!‚Äù ‚ÄúDid you hear about that flock of birds? I heard that hundreds of worms were eaten!‚Äù The dumpster is filled with the chatter of other worms. In worm culture, the dumpster is the place to see and be seen. You self-consciously smooth the membrane of your head; it's gotten all roughed up from all the digging you were doing.<br><br>You start in on a discarded chicken nugget. It‚Äôs highly nutritious.<br><br>There is a mysterious black bag in front of you. The end is open at the top. It looks full.<br><br>If you would like to go into the mysterious black bag, <a href='#9'>turn to page 9</a>.<br>If you would like to leave the dumpster, <a href='#98'>turn to page 98</a>.</p>

<p>‚Äú‚Ä¶ how you have enough money for getting high in the sky?‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúWell, I normally kind of keep my money hidden, but since you asked, I'll show you.‚Äù<br><br>Fly pulls out a coin with a strange symbol on it.<br><br><img class="symbol" src="/static/puzzle_resources/me-the-worm/symbol.png"><br><br>‚ÄúI found this weird coin the other day out on the pavement. I don't think it's worth a lot, but I decided to keep it anyway.‚Äù<br><br>If you would like to ask Fly what the symbol means, <a href='#6'>turn to the next page</a>.<br>If you would like to ask Fly something else, <a href='#112'>turn to page 112</a>.</p>

<p>‚ÄúDo you know what that symbol means?‚Äù you ask.<br><br>"The symbol on the coin? It means that the coin is important in this section of the book!

<h3 id="7">Page 7</h3>
<p>You bite into the apple with enthusiasm. Hey, it‚Äôs pretty good. You visit the solid core of the apple, having checked out the juicier bits, and you try eating one of the seeds. Suddenly, your vision blurs and you feel dizzy. The last thing you think of before you die is‚Ä¶ <i>oh, cyanide</i>.<br><br>THE END</p>

<h3 id="8">Page 8</h3>
<p>You take a look around. In one direction, there is a forest. Farther away, a mountain pokes up into the sky.<br><br>If you would like to go to the mountain, <a href='#94'>turn to page 94</a>.<br>If you would like to go to the forest, <a href='#90'>turn to page 90</a>.<br>If you would like to bask, <a href='#83'>turn to page 83</a>.<br>If you would like to go back home, <a href='#3'>turn to page 3</a>.</p>

<h3 id="9">Page 9</h3>
<p>The black bag is filled with some small shards of plastic and metal. Not exactly a good meal for a worm. You absentmindedly toss a pile of metal filings onto the ground. The filings arrange themselves into a pattern.<br><br><img class="symbol" src="/static/puzzle_resources/me-the-worm/symbol.png"><br><br>If you were paying attention, you would have found their spontaneous arrangement interesting. But you are distracted by a big, juicy fuji apple rotting right in front of you! Can you believe your luck!<br><br>You would like to eat the apple. <a href='#7'>Turn to page 7</a>.</p>

<h3 id="10">Page 10</h3>
<p>You approach the orange bird. ‚ÄúHey, just passing through!‚Äù you say weakly.<br><br>The bird catches sight of your movement, and its head swivels around so that both of its eyes are focused on you.<br><br>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a worm.‚Äù<br><br>A moment passes. The bird closes its eyes. Another moment passes. You continue to move forward.<br><br>Meanwhile, the sea of grass-covered worms has advanced farther.<br><br>It‚Äôs not long before you come across another branch with two more bird guards, a green bird and a yellow bird.<br><br>If you would like to talk to the green bird, <a href='#66'>turn to page 66</a>.<br>If you would like to talk to the yellow bird, <a href='#16'>turn to page 16</a>.</p>

<p>You open your eyes.<br><br>‚ÄúPraying Mantis, I feel nothing. Where is the Holy Worm?‚Äù<br><br>Praying Mantis says, ‚ÄúEncountering the Holy Worm requires restraint, and not just devotion. I think you prayed just three seconds too much.‚Äù<br><br><a href='#118'>Turn to page 118</a>.</p>

<p>You pull up to the street corner and start chilling so hard it should be a crime.<br><br>‚ÄúMe. The worm. Ah yesss,‚Äù you say to yourself.<br><br>Suddenly, you feel yourself lifted off the ground. A human has pinched you between two of its fingers!<br><br>‚ÄúHelp! Help! Help!‚Äù Your voice is clearly not heard by anyone bigger than a breadbox.<br><br>If you would like to bite the finger, <a href='#71'>turn to page 71</a>.<br>If you would like to squirm furiously, <a href='#22'>turn to page 22</a>.</p>

<p>You dig deeper. You dig faster. Your body writhes in furious contraction and expansion.<br><br>This is the farthest you‚Äôve ever been from home. <i>I am not afraid</i>.<br><br>The pressure starts to build. <i>Please, it‚Äôs nothing I can‚Äôt handle</i>.<br><br>It‚Äôs getting hot. Very hot. <i>I can do anything</i>.<br><br>You find yourself digging through a seething, burning, molten mass of liquid metal. Is your body still moving? You‚Äôve been compressed into a gooey pulp. <i>Nice</i>.<br><br>THE END</p>

<h3 id="22">Page 22</h3>
<p>You wriggle your little body as vigorously as it‚Äôs able, but to no avail.<br><br>‚ÄúWhat a fascinating specimen!‚Äù<br><br>The person is a worm collector (nematologist? nematophile? you can't really tell the difference from here‚Ä¶ maybe there are more important things to be thinking about right now). They put you in a clear box and put you on the shelf above the fireplace. You wonder what you‚Äôre doing here.<br><br>You live out the rest of your days hanging out in a box above the fireplace. Hey, at least you‚Äôre a warm worm here.<br><br>THE END</p>

<p>‚ÄúHey Bookworm, can you remind me about your Save the Worms movement again? It‚Äôs something about how worms are always drowning, right?‚Äù<br><br>Bookworm says, ‚ÄúSave the Worms is about the plight that we worms face when it rains. For a worm whose home has poor drainage due to disrepair, rain can force it to abandon its home and squirm out onto the pavement, which usually has some dry patches during a rainstorm.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúBut once out on the pavement, a worm is no longer safe. Besides the constant danger of birds, the primary threat is humans who step right on the poor worm. Human negligence is without parallel! Not to mention, I‚Äôve seen so many worms with midsections flattened by bicycle tires.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúThe movement is trying to do two things. First, we fix up worm houses which are in danger of flooding during rain. Second, we attempt to raise awareness in the human world so that not so many worms are stepped on during rainstorms.‚Äù<br><br>If you would like to contribute money towards the ‚ÄúSave the Worms‚Äù movement, you can <a target='_blank' href='https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=L4CVDVR3VTLZJ'>donate to us here</a>.<br>If you would like to ask Bookworm something else, <a href='#49'>turn to page 49</a>.</p>

The bird closes its eyes. Another moment passes. You continue to move forward.<br><br>Finally, the sea of grass-covered worms has made it to the nest! The worms push upward in unison, and the egg is lifted out of the basket of sticks. On silent slime, the egg is carried across the grass.<br><br>You give a sigh of relief. The white bird hears you and opens its eyes. Fear grips you, but its attention is caught by the large glistening egg gliding across the lawn.<br><br>‚ÄúOur egg! Our egg!‚Äù the bird caws in frenzied alarm.<br><br>The call is joined by birds in the surrounding trees. In the space of a few seconds, the air is filled with flapping wings and deadly beaks.<br><br>The company of worms has dropped the egg, which is now tumbling away down the hill. Dropping all pretense of secrecy, the worms scream and flee. Worms are being plucked and eaten left and right. You see Bookworm pounding away from a furious bird. Some worms burrow into the earth, their ends half-dangling out of the soil as bird beaks pluck them right back out.<br><br>You imagine phantom beaks pulling at your tail as you dive away in a different direction, heading towards the surrounding shrubbery.<br><br><a href='#144'>Turn to page 144.</a></p>
