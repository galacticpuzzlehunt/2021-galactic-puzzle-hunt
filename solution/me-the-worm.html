    <p>This puzzle is an absurd choose-your-own-adventure novel about being an earthworm. <a href="/solution/me-the-worm/book">You can read the full text here.</a>
Reading through the book<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, we can see that there are several possible endings, and also
on some pages there are objects with an asterisk (*) on them.
There are a couple other important things stated explicitly in the book.</p>

<p>Taking these things into consideration, there are fifteen different endings to the book.
If we study what happens in them, we are meant to observe that each one corresponds to a different
layer of the Earth (five layers each for the internal Earth, the ocean, and the atmosphere).
For example, in the ending on page 137, the Holy Worm lifts us to ‚Äúsomewhere between a height of 80km and 600km‚Äù. This matches the thermosphere.
Some of the endings are punny. For example, on page 46 we are spread onto the <em>crust</em> of bread.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in page number order, the endings/layers are sorted from Earth-internal to Earth-external
(the inner core comes first on page 7, the outer core is on page 21, and so on until the exosphere is on page 145, the last page of the book).
Since ‚Äúeach ending marks the ending of a layer‚Äù, we can think of pages from 1‚Äì7 as being the inner core, pages 8‚Äì21 as being the outer core, and so on.<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>This is summarized in the following table.

<p>Each layer that isn‚Äôt empty contains exactly one asterisk. The object clued on that page has the same length as the number of pages in the section/layer (ignoring the ending page of the layer, as instructed on page 6).
The object is also something that occurs/lives in that layer of the Earth, which can help us disambiguate
some of the descriptions.</p>
<p>Based on the fact that the length of the object‚Äôs name matches the number of pages, we use the asterisk position as an index
to get a single letter from each object. For example, writing INTERNATIONALSPACESTATION in the 25 pages in the mesosphere section between 112‚Äì136 (ignoring the ending page), the asterisk
takes the letter on page 121.
The answer is <strong>EAT THIS BOOK</strong> (which also fills in the contextual blanks on page 50).</p>

    <h2 id="authors-notes">Author&rsquo;s Notes</h2>
    <p>This puzzle went through a lot of phases before it arrived in its final state.</p>
<p>It was the first puzzle assigned an answer in the concert round. Back then, it was a text adventure with some persistent state. After four minutes, you would have to restart the text adventure, but some things (switches being flipped, doors being open, etc) might remain the same. We ideated a lot of puzzle mechanics for this idea, but we never really got to a point of a puzzle we were happy with.</p>
<p>So we went on to a second idea. We were assigned the answer EAT THIS BOOK, and we decided that naturally the best thing to do would be to write a puzzle that was a book whose reader was a bookworm. In this concept, the puzzle was a choose-your-own-adventure book like the final puzzle, but there were several subpuzzles that culminated in actions that the player character (also the author of the book) could take to change the book, like cutting out pages, burning pages (Fire Ant accidentally setting the book on fire), cutting holes in pages (Bookworm chewing holes), etc. We had a good chunk of this book brainstormed and had started to write it before we lost motivation and were distracted by finishing up the rest of the puzzles in the hunt. A week before hunt, this puzzle still hadn‚Äôt been written and we were lacking the motivation to implement and write something this complicated... but we needed a puzzle.</p>
<p>So Chris brainstormed changes and came up with version three, the extraction you see today. Jenna joined in at this point to help postprod the puzzle and write story text.</p>
<p>The puzzle was testsolved for the first time on the night of Tuesday, August 23 (3 days before hunt). The testsolve was originally scheduled for 10pm ET, then got pushed back because the puzzle was not done. Eventually it started at 1am ET. This first testsolving group got stuck because we weren‚Äôt cluing the extraction hard enough. This was pretty stressful, since we only had 2 more days to make the puzzle work.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, a new extraction scheme was proposed (using only the layers of the Earth instead of using items from each layer). However, we weren‚Äôt convinced that we had time to implement the change, nor that it was actually an improvement, so we settled for cluing the existing extraction harder.</p>
<p>The puzzle probably could have been more elegant with more testing and more iterations. But many people enjoyed the puzzle (we hope you will too!), and that‚Äôs the part that matters.</p>
<p><b>Jenna:</b> Writing this puzzle was a roller-coaster. It was so last minute that I sometimes got anxious or frustrated. At the same time, I loved the puzzle and was really happy to see testsolvers playing it. tl;dr - extremely fun AND extremely stressful</p>
<p><b>Azalea:</b> I got pretty demotivated on puzzle things and busy with real life around the time when we were trying to write the second version of the puzzle. I appreciated Chris taking that in stride and ideating a replacement idea on his own, and I appreciated Chris and Jenna doing the brunt of the writing while I wasn‚Äôt feeling up to it. I‚Äôm really happy with the puzzle we ended up with.</p>
<p><b>Chris:</b> It was surprising that thinking of the extraction actually took significantly longer than writing the book. The book was furiously written in two-ish days (not recommended!). Praise the Holy Worm!</p>

<p>‚ÄúDo you have anything we could cook in the butter?‚Äù, you ask. You‚Äôre not the biggest fan of butter on its own as a food.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOkay, okay... I get it,‚Äù says Butterfly. ‚ÄúNot everyone is the biggest fan of butter on its own as a food. I even get bored of it sometimes. Have you heard of potato chips?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúUhh I think I saw one on the ground by my house once... it was like twice my size‚Äù</p>
