<p>
The celebrated philosophers Aristotle, Bacon, Confucius, Descartes, Epicurus, Foucault, Godel, and Hypatia have all gathered tonight to partake in a nine-course dinner of the ages. But eating with philosophers is never easy, so it will be up to you to help them resolve any dining conundra that may arise.
</p>

<p>
Gather the following supplies:
<ul>
<li>A round table (large enough to comfortably seat eight; see ‚ÄúNotes on seating‚Äù below).</li>
<li>Eight members of your team (to portray the 8 philosophers above), hungry enough to eat a potentially very large amount of food (see ‚ÄúNotes on philosophers‚Äù below).</li>
<li>A 3-by-3-by-3 Rubik‚Äôs cube (see ‚ÄúNotes on Rubik‚Äôs cubes‚Äù below).</li>
<li>All the food and equipment mentioned in the below sections.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Notes on seating:
<ul>
<li>Throughout the dinner, the 8 philosophers will remain seated at the same locations along the table. Aristotle is seated at the head (top) of the table, and the remaining philosophers are seated in order clockwise from Aristotle, with 45 degree gaps between each pair of adjacent philosophers. See the seating diagram below for elaboration.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Notes on philosophers:
<ul>
<li>Philosophers are very precise and patient. If they are told to perform an action, they will wait until it is possible to perform that action exactly as specified, even if this involves waiting for a very long time.</li>
<li>Philosophers are very polite when it comes to passing objects. If a philosopher tries to pass an object (e.g. a salt shaker) to another philosopher, they will wait until the receiving philosopher is waiting to be passed an item. This politeness does not extend to other actions at the dinner table (e.g., eating food off others‚Äô plates).</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Notes on Rubik‚Äôs cubes:
<ul>
<li>All philosophers always hold the Rubik‚Äôs cube so that the white face is facing towards them and the red face is on top.</li>
<li>All philosophers are experienced cubists and understand the following notation describing operations to be performed on a Rubik‚Äôs cube: an upper case letter (one of U, D, L, R, F, B) indicates that the corresponding face (top, bottom, left, right, front, or back) be rotated 90 degrees clockwise. A lower case letter indicates that the corresponding face should be rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise.</li>
<li>You may find the website <a href="https://iamthecu.be/">https://iamthecu.be/</a> useful (but it is not necessary for solving this puzzle). Note that you can type in directions as they appear in this puzzle to perform the corresponding operations (in addition to using your mouse to perform operations).</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Course 1: Wiener schnitzel</h3>

<p><b>Setup:</b> Prepare eight servings of wiener schnitzel. Place one serving on a plate in front of each of the philosophers. Place a salt shaker and a solved Rubik‚Äôs cube in the center of the table.</p>
